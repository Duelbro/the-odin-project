    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Popcorn is a specific type of corn, that pops when heated up with some
      oil. As you might expect, this recipe is very simple.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (per 100g of popcorn)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g "raw" popcorn</li>
      <li>50g oil</li>
      <li>
        other ingredients you might want to add: salt/sugar, caramel, other
        spices...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat up the oil on medium-low heat in a pot with a lid</li>
      <li>Add the raw popcorn, if you haven't done so put on the lid</li>
      <li>
        The popcorn will start to audibly pop (keep the lid on to make sure that
        it doesn't jump out). Every now and then, shake up the pot a bit to
        prevent the corn from burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        If almost all the corn popped, it is done. You probably won't get all of
        the corn to pop.
      </li>
      <li>Now you can add salt and other optional ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
