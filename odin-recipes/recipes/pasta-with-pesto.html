    <h1>Pasta with Pesto</h1>

    <p>
      With Italy as my neighbor country, pasta and pesto are commonplace in
      supermarkets and a staple for students or families.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (per adult)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250g pasta</li>
      <li>50g pesto</li>
      <li>50g parmesan (ideally not grated beforehand)</li>
      <li>water</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put water in a pot (enough to cover the pasta when it is softened) and
        bring it to a boil
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt heavily, then add the pasta. Give it a stir. You can now turn down
        the heat a little bit, it should simmer but it doesn't have to boil.
        Cover half of the pot with a lid to preserve the heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait for the time given on the pasta packaging. Then try some noodles.
        You want them to still have a bit of bite, so ideally you should stop
        heating them as they are a bit too tough, because they will continue to
        cook a bit afterwards
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta, mix it with the pesto, grate and add parmesan as you
        like
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
